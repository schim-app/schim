.. On ReadTheDocs we want the prepared manpages to be in the man/ directory so
   the http link looks nicer (otherwise it would include _intermediate)

.. only:: ReadTheDocs

   .. toctree::
      :maxdepth: 1

      ../man/schim.rst
      ../man/schim-editor.rst
      ../man/schim-export.rst
      ../man/schim-report.rst
      ../man/schim-set.rst
      ../man/schim-alias.rst

.. only:: not ReadTheDocs

   .. toctree::
      :maxdepth: 1

      ../_intermediate/man/schim.rst
      ../_intermediate/man/schim-editor.rst
