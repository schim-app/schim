Component auto-completion
=========================

.. todo:: chapter name?

This feature is activated when you click on *Insert component* in the tool bar
or by pressing the appropriate keyboard shortcut. It has many features:

Completion by component name
----------------------------

When you enter text into the text box, Schim will first try to match any
component names. For example, if you enter `coi`, Schim will try to complete
it to `Coil`. By default, this type of completion is case-insensitive.

Completion by file name
-----------------------

If you enter part of a file name that defines a component, Schim will try to
complete it. The files are searched in the usual paths. By default, this type of
completion uses smart-case. This means that if the user enters only small
letters, the match will be case-insensitive; if the user enters text with
capital letters, the match will be case-sensitive.

.. todo:: Path specification

   Make a separate chapter defining ways a file path can be specified.
