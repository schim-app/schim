.. tip::

   Whenever you are unsure what something does, drag your mouse over it and
   press :guilabel:`Shift + F1`. This will open a help page for that widget, if
   one exists. This will work for many widgets. If you press only
   :guilabel:`F1`, a general help page will open.

Inserting objects
-----------------

The most straight-forward way to insert an object is by clicking the buttons on
the tool bar. Afterwards, clicking on the sheet determines the object's position
in the sheet. Some primitive objects require multiple clicks to be placed. For
example, a line requires two clicks to specify its first and second endpoints,
respectively.

If a component is selected, a popup appears asking the user for the type of
component to be inserted. The popup provides a rich auto-completion feature.
This popup can be used to insert primitive objects as well. The auto-completion
popup has many more features. Have a look at :ref:`auto_completion`.

Another way to insert a component is to find it in the component browser (TODO
name?) and simply drag it into the sheet. We recommend that you get familiar
with the auto-completion feature because it is much more efficient.
Keyboard-centric users will especially love this feature.
