A few notes
::::::::::::
This document is used both on GitHub/GitLab and inside the application's
built-in About page. In order to render nicely on GitHub/GitLab it has to have a
markdown (.md) extension, but in order to render correctly in the app the
contents have to be HTML. This is (to the best of my knowledge) a limitation of
QTextBrowser and QLabel. If you believe this can be fixed and the document
contents converted to markdown, do it and open a pull request.
Anyhow, if you edit this file for any reason, check how it looks on both
Git{Hub,Lab} and in the About page.
:::
NOTE: All image paths should start with ./ so they can be replaced with qrc://
equivalents when rendered in the app's About page.
